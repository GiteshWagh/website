**Print is a function that is used to display value. Print is an essential function in Python programming. Print is a simple but very useful function. We generally use a Print function to display string and integer values. Print is the first function that we learn during Python programming. Print function are display the string, integer and float values. We use the Print function in our first program "HelloWorld".**

# 2.input()
````python
x = input("Enter the number : ")
print(x) 
````

**Input is also a very important function. We use it to get input from the user. Generally, We take input from a user and store it in a variable for use later.  Input is also like a print function but the difference here is a print function only displays the value. The input also displays the value but the program ends after getting input from a user.**

# 3.Comments
```python
# This is my first program.
# this is my comment.
```

**Comments are text in code that is ignored by Python. Comment increases the readability of code and makes it understandable for others.**

# Creating Our First Program

```
