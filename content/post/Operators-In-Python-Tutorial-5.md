# What Are Operators In Python? 
### Operators are a symbol or small word which is useful to perform operations in Python.

****

# Type Of Operators
#### (1) Conditional Operators
#### (2) Logical Operators
#### (3) Identity Operators
#### (4) Arithmetic Operators
#### (5) Membership Operators
#### (6) Assignment Operators
#### (7) Bitwise Operator


********************
# Conditional / Comparison Operators In Python
```
Conditional / Comparison Operators In Python

<   Greater Than symbol            
>   Smaller Than symbol            
<=  Equal To And Greater Than      
>=  Equal To And Smaller Than      
==  Equal To                       
!=  Not Equal To                   
```
```
# Examples

1<2       # <   Greater Than symbol   
2>1       # >   Smaller Than symbol
i<=10     # <=  Equal To And Greater Than
i>=10     # >=  Equal To And Smaller Than 
x == 10   # ==  Equal To   
x != 10   # !=  Not Equal To
```
Conditional operators are symbols used for writing conditions in Python. Conditional operators are also known as **Comparison Operators**. Conditional Operators are **one of the most essential operator** types in Python.


*********************
# Logical Operators
```
Python Logical Operators

and      
or       
not      
```
```
# Example

i<10 and i2<20  # and
i<10 or i2<20   # or
i is not 3      # not
```
We use logical operators for giving more than one condition in Python. Logical operators are used to assign **multiple conditions** while coding. They are used to writing logic in Python. That's why these operators are known as logical operators in Python.

*************
# Identity Operators
```
Python Identity Operators

is         
is not    
```
```
# Examples

x is y (x=y=5) # is
x is not y     # is not
```

Identity operators are used to **compare** the variables in Python. Generally, We compare the value of variables with the help of an identity operator. Identity operators contain **is** and **is not** as shown.

****************************
# Arithmetic Operators

```
Python Arithmetic Operators

+   Addition  
-   Subtraction
*   Multiplication
/   Division
%   Modulus          
**  Exponentiation   
//  Floor division   
```
```
# Examples

9+3   # Output: 12
9-3   # Output: 6
9*3   # Output: 27 
9/3   # Output: 3
9%3   # Output: 0
9**3  # Output: 729
9//2  # Output: 4
```

Arithmetic operators are also known as **Mathematical Operators** in Python. We use them to perform **mathematical operations**.

***********************

# Membership Operators
```
Python Membership Operators

in       
not in      
```
```
# Examples

x in y      
x not in y  
```

Membership operators contain **is** and **is not**. We use it to show whether both variables **same or not**.

***************************************

# Assignment operators in Python

```
assignment operators in Python 

=   Simple assignment operator 
+=  Add and equal operator
-=  Subtract and equal operator 
*=  Asterisk and equal operator
/=  Divide and equal operator 
%=  Modulus and equal operator 
//= Double divide and equal operator 
```

We use **assignment operators** while **assigning values to variables**.

***********************************

### Example Code For Conditional Operators
```python
x = 13
if (x <= 13):
    print("X is smaller or equal to 13.")

elif (x >= 13):
    print("X is greater or equal to 13.")

elif (x == 13):
    print("X is equal to 13.")

elif (x != 1):
    print("X is not equal to 13.")

else:
    print("Other Value")
```

### Example Code For Arithmetic Operators
```python
print(" 1 + 2")
print(" 3 - 2")
print(" 1 * 2")
print(" 2 / 2")
print(" 3 % 2")
print(" 4**2")
print(" 5//2")
```
