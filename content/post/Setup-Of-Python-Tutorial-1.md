#### Hello Friendsüëã,  
You know that Python is the most straightforward programming language for 
beginners. Today, We will see how to download and set up Python with VS Codium. 
VS Codium is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). VS Codium is a simple 
and powerful tool for coding. 

VS Codium provides many important and latest features. VS Codium is a lightweight but powerful tool. VS Codium helps you a lot in your coding journey. I use VS Codium for coding and web development. I also use VS Codium for building this site. 

So Let's Get Started. 

### Step 1: Download the Python interpreter.

Use only the official website of Python for downloading Python interpreter.   Download an interpreter for your operating system. The process is too simple. Download and install it like software.

Use a Package Manager (deb/rpm, provided by VSCodium related repository)
@paulcarroty has set up a repository for VSCodium. The instructions below are 
adapted from there with CDN mirror. Any issues installing VSCodium using your 
package manager should be directed to that repository‚Äôs issue tracker.
@jtagcat set up an hourly mirror of @paulcarroty‚Äôs repository.
To use the mirror, you may replace paulcarroty.gitlab.io/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo 
with vscodium.c7.ee in your package manager configuration.

**Install on Debian / Ubuntu (deb package)**:
Add the GPG key of the repository:
```ruby

    | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/vscodium-archive-keyring.gpg
```
**Add the repository**:
```ruby
echo 'deb [ signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/vscodium-archive-keyring.gpg ]
