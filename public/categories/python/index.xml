            Project 4 : Calculator In Python This Python project is a basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations on two numbers. The project employs fundamental programming concepts like functions, if-else statements, variables, and datatypes to provide a simple calculator interface.
Here&#39;s a description of the project in simple language:
Introduction and Instructions: The program begins by displaying a message to the user. It explains how to use the calculator by entering specific keywords like &#39;add&#39;, &#39;sub&#39;, &#39;multi&#39;, &#39;div&#39;, and &#39;power&#39; for different arithmetic operations.

            WHAT ARE MATCH CASES IN PYTHON? Match Cases is a method for writing conditions in Python programming. Here, We create conditions related to the value of a variable. In If-Else statements, we define the condition with the help of conditional operators. But, Here, In Match Cases the value of the variable is a condition. In Match Cases we write, What will happen when the value of a variable is 1, 2, 3, etc.

            What is If-Else statement ? An if-Else statement is a method for writing conditions. Another method available today is match cases. We start writing our first condition by using the &#39;if&#39; keyword and the other by using the keyword &#39;elif&#39;. The last condition was else it runs when other conditions will not execute. Every condition contains some code, It runs when the condition will be executed.

            Variables 1Variabl1e1 = 24565876575678 2x = input() 3print(x) 4print(Variabl1e1) Here I created a variable called &amp;quot;Variable1&amp;quot;. Variables are use for storing data. Variables are like containers, they contain values.** First of all, write the name of the variable, Use the = sign, and assign the value. This is the syntax to create variables in Python programming.
These are some example variables.
1a = 12345 2b = &amp;#34;abc123&amp;#34; 3c = 12.

Print is an essential function in Python programming. Print is a simple but very useful function. We generally use a Print function to display string and integer values. Print is the first function that we learn during Python programming. Print function are display the string, integer and float values.
