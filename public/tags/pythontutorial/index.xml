            Loops In Python Loops are used to execute a specific code many times instead of writing code again and again.
Types of Loops: 1. For Loops
2. While Loops
 For loop For Loop is more used than While Loops. For Loops are used for different purposes in different ways.
 In this example, I used For Loops along with the if-else statement. Here, i is List and k is a variable containing elements of list.

            Project 4 : Calculator In Python This Python project is a basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations on two numbers. The project employs fundamental programming concepts like functions, if-else statements, variables, and datatypes to provide a simple calculator interface.
Here&#39;s a description of the project in simple language:
  Introduction and Instructions: The program begins by displaying a message to the user. It explains how to use the calculator by entering specific keywords like &#39;add&#39;, &#39;sub&#39;, &#39;multi&#39;, &#39;div&#39;, and &#39;power&#39; for different arithmetic operations.

            WHAT ARE MATCH CASES IN PYTHON? Match Cases is a method for writing conditions in Python programming. Here, We create conditions related to the value of a variable. In If-Else statements, we define the condition with the help of conditional operators. But, Here, In Match Cases the value of the variable is a condition. In Match Cases we write, What will happen when the value of a variable is 1, 2, 3, etc.

            What is If-Else statement ? An if-Else statement is a method for writing conditions. Another method available today is match cases. We start writing our first condition by using the &#39;if&#39; keyword and the other by using the keyword &#39;elif&#39;. The last condition was else it runs when other conditions will not execute. Every condition contains some code, It runs when the condition will be executed.
